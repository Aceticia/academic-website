About
======
Hi! I'm Chris, a PhD student in New York University supervised by [Eric K. Oermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-oermann-b829528/), and [Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang). I'm interested in how brains work, and how we can use deep learning to better understand how they work, and when they break down.
